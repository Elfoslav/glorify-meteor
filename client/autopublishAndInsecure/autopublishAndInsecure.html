  <h2>Autopublish and Insecure packages</h2>
  <p>
    By default meteor application contains Autopublish and Insecure packages.
    <b>They are good for prototyping your application quickly</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Autopublish package</b> publishes all your data (collections) from the server to the client.
    You don't need to think about what data you need where. But once you want to use the application
    in production you need to use <a href="{{pathFor 'publishSubscribe'}}">Publish & Subscribe</a> functions.
    Imagine you have millions of records in your collections and they are downloaded to the client - WRONG -
    you need to publish just a subset of the data. Another example is users collection - you don't want
    to publish user's email or another private data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Insecure package</b> is great for prototyping. You can insert, update and remove your data right
    from developers console and they are reactively shown in template.
  </p>
  <p>Try this in your console:</p>

<pre>
Books.insert({ title: 'Discover Meteor', author: 'Tom Coleman & Sacha Greif'});
</pre>

  <ul>
  {{#each books}}
    <li title="{{_id}}">{{title}} by {{author}}</li>
  {{else}}
    <li>No books</li>
  {{/each}}
  </ul>

  <p>To delete a document from client code you need to specify id of the document:</p>

  {{#if oneBook}}
    <div class="well well-sm well-dark css hljs">
      <span class="hljs-tag">Books</span><span class="hljs-class">.remove</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'{{oneBook._id}}'</span>);
    </div>
  {{/if}}

  <p>Please delete what you created. Don't mess me this page. Thanks :-)</p>

  <p>I strongly recommend to remove Autopublish and Insecure packages before deploying production app:</p>

<pre>
$ meteor remove autopublish
$ meteor remove insecure
</pre>
